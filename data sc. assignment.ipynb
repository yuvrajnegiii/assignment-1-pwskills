    "    Ans-Python was created by Guido van Rossum , and first released on february 20 , 1991.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Q2- Which type of programming does python support?\n",
    "    Ans- Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object Oriented Programming and Structured Programming are fully supported , and many of their features support functional \n",
    "         programming and aspect-oriented programming (including meta programming and meta objects).\n",

    "    Q3- Is python case sensitive while dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "    Ans-YES, Python is a case sensitive language , i.e , it treats uppercase and lowecase charachters differently. This applies to identifiers too. We should avoid using the same name \n",
    "        with different cases while naming identifiers. It is always good to use names that are more easily understood.\n",
    "        \n",

    "    \n",
    "    Q6- Name a few blocks of code used to define in python languages?\n",
    "    Ans- A python program is constructed from code blocks. A block is a piece of python program text is executed as a unit. the following are blocks: \n",
    "         a) a module\n",
    "         b) a function body \n",

    "            \n",
    "    Q7- State a charachter used to give single-line comments in python?\n",
    "    Ans- We can write a single \"#\" charachter before any statement or line of code.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Q8- Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "    Ans- The function sys.version can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Q9- Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called?\n",
    "    Ans- Python uses construct called (\"lambda\") which supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime.\n",
